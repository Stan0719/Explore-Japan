		Sushi is one of the all-time favourite and well-known Japanese foods around the world. It is served in various ways and prices. One example is the entertaining Kaiten-zushi also know as conveyor belt sushi, where customers can enjoy sushi for a reasonable price.
		Sushi is a dish of slightly sweet, vinegared rice often paired with a piece of raw fish or shellfish, called a neta, on top. It is typically enjoyed with soy sauce and wasabi to enhance the flavour.
		There are 6 different types of sushi which are Sashimi, Nigirizushi, Makizushi, Uramakizushi, Temakizushi and Chirashizushi. Sashimi is thinly sliced fish or meat, often served raw paired with sauces like ponzu and soy sauce. Nigirizushi is a pillow of vinegared rice with a topping of raw or cooked seafood. Makizushi is vinegared rice and fillings layered with a sheet of seaweed. Uramakizushi is rolled sushi with rice on the outside and nori on the inside. Temakizushi is a large seaweed cone stuffed with rice, fish and other sushi fillings. Chirashizushi features a bed of sushi rice covered with toppings.
