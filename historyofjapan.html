                <td>Japan was governed by a feudal system, primarily under the rule of shoguns who held the real power, while the emperor was a symbolic leader. Power was decentralized, distributed among the samurai and feudal lords (daimyo), and society was structured around loyalty to one's lord.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Foreign Relations and Military</td>
                <td>Isolationist policies, especially during the Edo period (1603-1868), limited Japan’s interaction with other nations. Trade and diplomacy were highly restricted, with only limited contact through specific foreign ports.</td>

Today, Japan has a democratic government with an elected parliament (Diet) and a prime minister, with the emperor serving as a ceremonial figure.</td>
